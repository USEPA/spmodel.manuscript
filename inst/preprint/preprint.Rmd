# Introduction \label{sec:introduction}

Here we describe the general role of spatial modeling, discuss existing software, and argue spmodel is a valuable contribution.

# Background and Usage

## Spatial Linear Models

* REML citations [@patterson1971recovery; @harville1977maximum; @wolfinger1994computing]
* SV-WLS citations [@cressie1985fitting; @cressie1993statistics]
* SV-CL citations [@curriero1999composite]

### Anisotropy

## Spatial Autoregressive Models

## Prediction
